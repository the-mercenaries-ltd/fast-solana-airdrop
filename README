This will allow you to airdrop roughly 60 token accounts per minute :)

This is less of a script, and more a repeatable workflow. As such it might be easier to watch me go through it on this video.

(note: this video is missing the full part of note b: "set the tokenMint and rpcUrl" 
remember to set both variables inside 1-download-token-snapshot.js)

Part two:

Notes:
a. replace whitelist-accounts.json with your whitelist sheet
b. set the tokenMint and rpcUrl
c. try this workflow on a small number of accounts (1-3 to begin with)
d. run the scripts in order (1 2, 3, etc.)
e. once you have airdrop-script.sh, run chmod 777 ./out/airdrop-script.sh
